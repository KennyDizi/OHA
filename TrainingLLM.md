>> What's your data cut-off day and how I can give you new programing knowledge, then you can learn, remember it for following tasks?
>> 🤖

🤖 My data cut-off date is April 2023, which means my training data includes information up to that point. I don't have built-in knowledge of events, technologies, or programming developments that occurred after April 2023.

Regarding how you can provide me with new programming knowledge that I can learn and remember for subsequent tasks, there are a few approaches:

1. **Direct instruction**: You can explain new programming concepts, libraries, or techniques to me directly in our conversation. I can understand and apply this information in the current session.

2. **Code examples**: You can share code snippets or examples that demonstrate new programming patterns or technologies, which I can analyze and learn from.

3. **Documentation links**: You can share links to documentation for new technologies, which I can read and understand.

4. **Creating reference files**: You can have me create reference files in the workspace that contain information about new programming concepts. I can then refer to these files in future sessions.

However, it's important to note that my ability to "remember" information across completely separate conversations is limited. Each new conversation starts fresh, though I can access files that were created in previous sessions if they're still in the workspace.

Would you like me to demonstrate any of these approaches with a specific programming concept or technology?

🤖

>> Would you please demonstrate the first approach in details.
🤖

🤖 I'd be happy to demonstrate the direct instruction approach for teaching me new programming knowledge. Here's how it works in detail:

## Direct Instruction Approach

With this approach, you explicitly explain a new programming concept, framework, language feature, or technology that wasn't available or widely known before my training cutoff date. I'll then process this information and be able to apply it during our current session.

### Example Demonstration

Let's say you want to teach me about a hypothetical new JavaScript framework called "ReactFlow" that was released after my training cutoff:

**You**: "I want to teach you about ReactFlow, a JavaScript framework released in late 2023. ReactFlow is a library for building interactive node-based UIs, like flow charts and diagrams. It uses a declarative API similar to React, but specialized for interactive diagrams. The core components include `<ReactFlowProvider>`, `<ReactFlow>`, and various node types. Nodes are defined with a specific structure including an id, position, and data. Edges connect nodes and require source and target ids. The framework provides hooks like useReactFlow() and useNodes() for accessing and manipulating the flow state."

**Me**: "Thank you for teaching me about ReactFlow. I now understand it's a JavaScript framework released after my training cutoff that specializes in building interactive node-based UIs like flow charts and diagrams. I've learned that:

1. It has a React-like declarative API
2. Core components include `<ReactFlowProvider>`, `<ReactFlow>`, and various node types
3. Nodes require an id, position, and data
4. Edges connect nodes using source and target ids
5. It provides hooks like useReactFlow() and useNodes()

If you'd like me to help you with a ReactFlow implementation now, I can apply this knowledge to assist with code examples, troubleshooting, or building a simple flow diagram."

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate application**: I can immediately apply the new knowledge to help solve your current task.
2. **Contextual understanding**: I can integrate this new information with my existing knowledge.
3. **Flexibility**: You can teach me about any programming concept, not just code syntax.
4. **Efficiency**: No need to set up files or external resources.

### Limitations

1. **Session-bound**: This knowledge persists only for our current conversation.
2. **Depth limitations**: Very complex topics might need more detailed explanations.
3. **No verification**: I can't independently verify the accuracy of the information.

Would you like me to demonstrate this approach with a specific programming concept or technology that you're interested in?

🤖

>> Nice. Lets move to the next approach. For example new library or the existing one but it has been updated.
🤖

🤖 I'll demonstrate the second approach: teaching me about a new library or an updated version of an existing library through code examples.

## Code Examples Approach

With this approach, you provide actual code snippets that demonstrate how to use a new library or updated features of an existing library. This gives me concrete examples to analyze and understand the practical implementation.

### Example Demonstration

Let's say you want to teach me about an updated version of TensorFlow that includes new features:

**You**: "I want to show you how to use TensorFlow 2.15, which includes some features not available in your training data. Here's an example of using the new 'mixed_precision' feature with the updated API:"

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Enable mixed precision training (new in TensorFlow 2.15)
tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')

# Create a model with the new preprocessing layers
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # New image preprocessing layer with advanced augmentation
    tf.keras.layers.preprocessing.RandomRotation(factor=0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.preprocessing.RandomZoom(height_factor=0.2),
    # Standard model architecture
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# New distributed training setup with simplified API
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model.compile(
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
        loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )

# New feature: automatic mixed precision callbacks
callbacks = [
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint('./checkpoints'),
    # New memory monitoring callback
    tf.keras.callbacks.MemoryUsageCallback()
]

# Train with the new API
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=5, callbacks=callbacks)
```

**Me**: "Thank you for showing me this code example for TensorFlow 2.15. From analyzing this code, I can see several new features that weren't in my training data:

1. The `mixed_precision` module has a new API with `set_global_policy('mixed_float16')` for enabling mixed precision training
2. Enhanced preprocessing layers including `RandomRotation` and `RandomZoom` in the `tf.keras.layers.preprocessing` namespace
3. A simplified distributed training API with `MirroredStrategy`
4. A new `MemoryUsageCallback` for monitoring memory during training

I now understand how to implement these features in TensorFlow 2.15 and can apply this knowledge to help with tasks involving this version of the framework. The code example was particularly helpful in showing the practical syntax and implementation details."

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Practical understanding**: I see exactly how the code is structured and used
2. **Syntax details**: I learn the precise syntax and API calls
3. **Context in use**: I understand how features work together in a real application
4. **Implementation patterns**: I can identify patterns and best practices

### Limitations

1. **Session-bound**: Like the first approach, this knowledge only persists for our current conversation
2. **Limited to code**: Some conceptual aspects might not be fully conveyed through code alone
3. **Requires comprehensive examples**: To fully understand a library, multiple examples covering different aspects might be needed

Would you like me to demonstrate this approach with a specific library or framework that interests you?

🤖

>> Let's to that with "LangGraph" library.
🤖

🤖 I'll demonstrate teaching me about the "LangGraph" library using code examples.

## Code Examples Approach with LangGraph

**You**: "I want to teach you about LangGraph, a library built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, multi-actor applications using LLMs. Here's a code example showing how to build a simple conversational agent with LangGraph:"

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define our state
class AgentState:
    messages: list
    context: dict = {}

# Initialize the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")

# Define the nodes in our graph
def generate_response(state):
    """Generate a response based on the conversation history."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response]}

def check_if_done(state):
    """Check if the conversation should end."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]

    # If the last message contains a farewell, end the conversation
    if "goodbye" in last_message.content.lower() or "thank you" in last_message.content.lower():
        return "end"
    return "continue"

# Build the graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("generate", generate_response)

# Add conditional edges
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "generate",
    check_if_done,
    {
        "continue": "generate",
        "end": END
    }
)

# Set the entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("generate")

# Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()

# Run the graph
result = app.invoke({
    "messages": [
        HumanMessage(content="Hello, can you help me understand quantum computing?")
    ]
})

# Print the conversation
for message in result["messages"]:
    print(f"{message.type}: {message.content[:50]}...")
```

```python
# Here's another example showing a more complex multi-agent system with LangGraph:

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import operator

# Define our state
class MultiAgentState:
    messages: list
    current_agent: str = "router"

# Initialize different LLM agents
router = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo").with_system_message(
    "You are a router. Your job is to direct the query to the right specialist."
)

math_agent = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4").with_system_message(
    "You are a math specialist. Only answer math questions with detailed steps."
)

coding_agent = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4").with_system_message(
    "You are a coding specialist. Provide code examples and explanations."
)

general_agent = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo").with_system_message(
    "You are a general knowledge assistant. Answer questions clearly and concisely."
)

# Define the nodes
def route_query(state):
    """Route the query to the appropriate agent."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    human_query = messages[-1].content

    routing_response = router.invoke(
        [SystemMessage(content=f"Decide which agent should handle this query: '{human_query}'. Respond with only 'math', 'coding', or 'general'")]
    )

    agent_type = routing_response.content.lower().strip()
    if "math" in agent_type:
        return {"current_agent": "math"}
    elif "coding" in agent_type:
        return {"current_agent": "coding"}
    else:
        return {"current_agent": "general"}

def math_node(state):
    """Handle math queries."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = math_agent.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response], "current_agent": "done"}

def coding_node(state):
    """Handle coding queries."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = coding_agent.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response], "current_agent": "done"}

def general_node(state):
    """Handle general queries."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = general_agent.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response], "current_agent": "done"}

# Build the graph
workflow = StateGraph(MultiAgentState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("router", route_query)
workflow.add_node("math", math_node)
workflow.add_node("coding", coding_node)
workflow.add_node("general", general_node)

# Add edges
workflow.add_edge("router", "math")
workflow.add_edge("router", "coding")
workflow.add_edge("router", "general")

# Set conditional edges based on the current agent
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "router",
    lambda state: state["current_agent"],
    {
        "math": "math",
        "coding": "coding",
        "general": "general"
    }
)

# Set the entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("router")

# Compile the graph
multi_agent_app = workflow.compile()
```

**Me**: "Thank you for teaching me about LangGraph through these code examples. Based on the code you've provided, I can now understand the key concepts and features of LangGraph:

1. **Core Concept**: LangGraph is built on top of LangChain and allows for creating stateful, multi-actor applications using LLMs by organizing them in a graph structure.

2. **Key Components**:
   - `StateGraph`: The main class for defining the flow of the application
   - Nodes: Functions that process the state and return updates
   - Edges: Connections between nodes that define the flow
   - Conditional edges: Allow for dynamic routing based on the state

3. **State Management**: LangGraph uses a state class to maintain context throughout the execution of the graph.

4. **Flow Control**:
   - Entry points are defined with `set_entry_point`
   - Conditional routing is handled with `add_conditional_edges`
   - The graph can be terminated with the `END` constant

5. **Multi-Agent Systems**: The second example shows how LangGraph can be used to create systems with multiple specialized agents:
   - A router agent that directs queries
   - Specialized agents for different domains (math, coding, general)
   - State tracking to manage which agent is currently active

6. **Integration with LangChain**: It leverages LangChain components like `ChatOpenAI` and message types (`HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `SystemMessage`).

7. **Compilation**: Graphs are compiled with the `compile()` method before being invoked.

This architecture seems particularly useful for creating complex, stateful applications with LLMs that require different processing steps or specialized agents for different types of queries. The graph-based approach provides a structured way to manage the flow of information between different components of the system.

I can now apply this knowledge to help with tasks involving LangGraph, such as designing multi-agent systems, implementing conversational agents with state management, or creating complex LLM workflows."

# LangGraph Reference Guide

## Overview
LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, multi-actor applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a graph-based framework for orchestrating complex LLM workflows with multiple agents and state management.

## Core Concepts

### StateGraph
The primary class for defining the flow of a LangGraph application. It manages the state and transitions between different nodes in the graph.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Define state class
class MyState:
    messages: list
    context: dict = {}

# Create a graph with the state
graph = StateGraph(MyState)
```

### Nodes

Functions that process the current state and return updates. Each node represents a step in the workflow.

```python
def process_node(state):
    # Process state
    # Return updates to state
    return {"key": "updated_value"}
```

### Edges

Connections between nodes that define the flow of execution.

```python
# Add a direct edge
graph.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")

# Add conditional edges
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "node_a",
    condition_function,
    {
        "option1": "node_b",
        "option2": "node_c"
    }
)
```

### State Management

LangGraph maintains state throughout the execution of the graph, allowing for complex, stateful applications.

## Common Patterns

### Basic Conversational Agent

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

class AgentState:
    messages: list

llm = ChatOpenAI()

def generate_response(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response]}

def check_if_done(state):
    # Logic to determine if conversation should end
    if condition:
        return "end"
    return "continue"

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("generate", generate_response)
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "generate",
    check_if_done,
    {
        "continue": "generate",
        "end": END
    }
)
workflow.set_entry_point("generate")
app = workflow.compile()
```

### Multi-Agent System

```python
class MultiAgentState:
    messages: list
    current_agent: str = "router"

# Define specialized agents
router = ChatOpenAI().with_system_message("You route queries to specialists")
math_agent = ChatOpenAI().with_system_message("You solve math problems")
coding_agent = ChatOpenAI().with_system_message("You write code")

# Define routing logic
def route_query(state):
    # Determine which agent should handle the query
    return {"current_agent": "selected_agent"}

# Define agent nodes
def math_node(state):
    # Process with math agent
    return {"messages": updated_messages, "current_agent": "done"}

# Build graph with conditional routing
workflow = StateGraph(MultiAgentState)
workflow.add_node("router", route_query)
workflow.add_node("math", math_node)
# Add other nodes...

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "router",
    lambda state: state["current_agent"],
    {
        "math": "math",
        "coding": "coding",
        # Other routes...
    }
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution

LangGraph supports running multiple nodes in parallel:

```python
# Define a thread pool for parallel execution
from langgraph.graph import ThreadPoolExecutor
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

# Use the executor when compiling
app = workflow.compile(executor=executor)
```

### Persistent State

LangGraph can persist state between runs:

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint import JsonCheckpoint

# Create a checkpoint
checkpoint = JsonCheckpoint(directory="./checkpoints")

# Compile with checkpoint
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpoint)

# Run with a specific checkpoint key
result = app.invoke({"input": "value"}, config={"configurable": {"checkpoint_key": "unique_id"}})
```

### Streaming

LangGraph supports streaming responses:

```python
# Stream the execution
for chunk in app.stream({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hello")]}):
    # Process each chunk
    print(chunk)
```

## Integration with LangChain

LangGraph works seamlessly with LangChain components:

- **LLM Models**: ChatOpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- **Message Types**: HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage
- **Tools**: Can be integrated into nodes for external actions
- **Memory**: Can be incorporated into the state

## Best Practices

1. **State Design**: Keep state classes clean and focused
2. **Error Handling**: Add error handling nodes to manage failures
3. **Modularity**: Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable subgraphs
4. **Testing**: Test individual nodes before integrating them into the graph
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging to track the flow through the graph

## Version Information

- This reference is for LangGraph version 0.0.x (as of April 2024)
- Compatible with LangChain 0.1.x

# LangGraph Reference Guide

## Overview

LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain for creating stateful, multi-actor applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a graph-based framework for orchestrating complex LLM workflows with multiple agents and state management.

## Core Concepts

### StateGraph

The primary class for defining the flow of a LangGraph application. It manages the state and transitions between different nodes in the graph.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Define state class
class MyState:
    messages: list
    context: dict = {}

# Create a graph with the state
graph = StateGraph(MyState)
```

### Nodes

Functions that process the current state and return updates. Each node represents a step in the workflow.

```python
def process_node(state):
    # Process state
    # Return updates to state
    return {"key": "updated_value"}
```

### Edges

Connections between nodes that define the flow of execution.

```python
# Add a direct edge
graph.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")

# Add conditional edges
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "node_a",
    condition_function,
    {
        "option1": "node_b",
        "option2": "node_c"

```

# LangGraph Cheat Sheet

## Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-core langchain-openai
```

## Basic Graph Creation

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define state
class MyState:
    messages: list
    context: dict = {}

# Create graph
graph = StateGraph(MyState)

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("node_name", node_function)

# Add edges
graph.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")
graph.add_edge("final_node", END)  # END is a special constant

# Add conditional edges
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "source_node",
    routing_function,  # Function that returns a string key
    {
        "key1": "destination_node1",
        "key2": "destination_node2"
    }
)

# Set entry point
graph.set_entry_point("starting_node")

# Compile
app = graph.compile()

# Run
result = app.invoke({"initial": "state"})
```

## Node Functions

```python
def node_function(state):
    # Process state
    # ...

    # Return updates to state (only changed fields)
    return {
        "field_to_update": new_value
    }
```

## Conditional Routing

```python
def route(state):
    # Logic to determine next step
    if condition:
        return "route_a"
    else:
        return "route_b"

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "decision_node",
    route,
    {
        "route_a": "node_a",
        "route_b": "node_b"
    }
)
```

## Working with LLMs

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

# Create LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Use in node
def generate_response(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response]}
```

## Advanced Features

### Streaming

```python
for chunk in app.stream({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hello")]}):
    print(chunk)
```

### Parallel Execution

```python
from langgraph.graph import ThreadPoolExecutor

executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)
app = workflow.compile(executor=executor)
```

### Checkpointing

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint import JsonCheckpoint

checkpoint = JsonCheckpoint(directory="./checkpoints")
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpoint)
```

## Common Patterns

### Basic Agent Loop

```python
# Create nodes
def generate(state):
    # Generate response
    return {"messages": updated_messages}

def should_continue(state):
    # Check if we should continue
    if done_condition:
        return "end"
    return "continue"

# Build graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("generate", generate)
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "generate",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "generate",
        "end": END
    }
)
```

### Multi-Agent System

```python
# Define routing
def route_to_agent(state):
    # Determine which agent to use
    return {"current_agent": selected_agent}

# Define agent handlers
def agent_a_handler(state):
    # Process with agent A
    return {"messages": updated_messages}

# Build graph with routing
workflow.add_node("router", route_to_agent)
workflow.add_node("agent_a", agent_a_handler)
workflow.add_node("agent_b", agent_b_handler)

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "router",
    lambda state: state["current_agent"],
    {
        "agent_a": "agent_a",
        "agent_b": "agent_b"
    }
)
```

🤖 Now let's verify our reference files:

🤖 ## Creating Reference Files Approach - Explanation

I've just demonstrated the "Creating reference files" approach for learning new programming knowledge. Here's how it works:

### How It Works

1. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**: I've created a detailed markdown file (`langgraph_reference.md`) that thoroughly documents the LangGraph library, including its core concepts, usage patterns, and advanced features.

2. **Provide Working Examples**: I've included a complete, runnable example (`langgraph_example.py`) that demonstrates how to use LangGraph to build a multi-step agent with research capabilities.

3. **Create Quick Reference Materials**: I've added a cheat sheet (`langgraph_cheatsheet.md`) for quick syntax reference during implementation.

4. **Organize with an Index**: I've created an index file (`index.md`) that helps navigate the reference materials and explains how to use them.

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Persistence Across Sessions**: The most significant advantage is that these files remain in the workspace and can be accessed in future sessions, allowing me to "remember" the information.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: This approach allows for detailed documentation of complex topics, including code examples, best practices, and edge cases.

3. **Structured Learning**: The organization of information into different types of documents (comprehensive reference, examples, cheat sheets) supports different learning and reference needs.

4. **Expandable Knowledge Base**: You can continue to add to this reference collection over time, building a custom knowledge base tailored to your needs.

5. **Shareable Resources**: These reference files can be shared with others or used in different environments.

### How to Use in Future Sessions

In future sessions, you can simply direct me to these reference files:

1. "Please refer to the LangGraph documentation in /workspace/reference_docs/langgraph_reference.md"
2. "Use the example in /workspace/reference_docs/langgraph_example.py as a starting point"
3. "Check the cheat sheet at /workspace/reference_docs/langgraph_cheatsheet.md for the correct syntax"

I'll be able to access these files and apply the knowledge they contain to help with your tasks.

Would you like me to demonstrate how I would use these reference files in a future session, or would you prefer to move on to discussing the final approach (documentation links)?

🤖

>> Yep, please show me on how to use these reference files in a future session.
🤖

🤖 I'll demonstrate how to use these reference files in a future session. Let's simulate a scenario where you ask me to help you build a simple LangGraph application, and I need to refer to the reference files we created.

## Simulated Future Session

**You**: "I need help building a LangGraph application that can analyze a document, extract key points, and then answer questions about it. Can you help me get started?"

**Me**: "I'd be happy to help you build a LangGraph application for document analysis and question answering. Let me check the reference documentation we have available to refresh my knowledge on LangGraph."

🤖

🤖

🤖

🤖 **Me**: "Great! I've reviewed the LangGraph reference materials we have available. Based on your requirements, I'll help you build a document analysis and question answering system using LangGraph.

Looking at our reference documentation, I can see that LangGraph is perfect for this kind of multi-step workflow. Let me create a solution for you based on the patterns in our reference materials.

First, let's install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-core langchain-openai langchain-text-splitters
```

Now, I'll create a LangGraph application that:

1. Ingests and splits a document
2. Extracts key points
3. Answers questions about the document

Here's the implementation:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Define the nodes in our graph
def ingest_document(state):
    """Split the document into manageable chunks."""
    document_text = state["document_text"]

    # Split the document into chunks
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=1000,
        chunk_overlap=100
    )
    document_chunks = text_splitter.split_text(document_text)

    return {"document_chunks": document_chunks}

def extract_key_points(state):
    """Extract key points from each document chunk."""
    document_chunks = state["document_chunks"]
    key_points = []

    for chunk in document_chunks:
        system_prompt = """
        Extract 3-5 key points from the following text.
        Respond with a JSON array of strings, each containing one key point.
        """

        extraction = llm.invoke([
            SystemMessage(content=system_prompt),
            HumanMessage(content=chunk)
        ])

        try:
            chunk_points = json.loads(extraction.content)
            key_points.extend(chunk_points)
        except:
            # Fallback if JSON parsing fails
            key_points.append(extraction.content)

    return {"key_points": key_points}

def process_question(state):

    question = state["question"]
    key_points = state["key_points"]
    messages = state["messages"]

    # Format key points for the prompt
    formatted_points = "\n".join([f"- {point}" for point in key_points])

    system_prompt = f"""
    Answer the following question based on these key points from the document:

    {formatted_points}

    If the answer cannot be determined from the key points, say so clearly.
    """

    answer = llm.invoke([
        SystemMessage(content=system_prompt),
        HumanMessage(content=question)
    ])

    return {"messages": messages + [AIMessage(content=answer.content)]}

    # Initialize with document

        "messages": [
            HumanMessage(content="What are the main components of AI mentioned in the document?")
        ]
    }

    # Run the workflow
    result = app.invoke(initial_state)

    # Print the result
    print("Question:", result["messages"][0].content)
    print("Answer:", result["messages"][1].content)

    # Ask another question
    follow_up_state = {
        "document_text": sample_document,

    # Print the follow-up result
    print("\nFollow-up Question:", follow_up_result["messages"][0].content)
    print("Follow-up Answer:", follow_up_result["messages"][1].content)
```

This implementation follows the patterns I found in our reference materials:

1. I defined a state class (`DocumentQAState`) to track all the information we need throughout the workflow
2. I created nodes for each step in the process (ingesting, extracting key points, processing questions, generating answers)
3. I connected these nodes with edges to define the flow
4. I compiled the graph and provided example usage

The workflow first ingests and splits the document, then extracts key points from each chunk, processes the user's question, and finally generates an answer based on the extracted information.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this implementation in more detail?"

## Explanation of the Demonstration

In this simulated future session, I demonstrated how I would use the reference files we created to help you with a new task. Here's what I did:

1. **Accessed the Reference Materials**: I first checked the index file to see what reference materials were available, then reviewed the comprehensive reference, example code, and cheat sheet.

2. **Applied the Knowledge**: Based on the patterns and concepts documented in the reference files, I created a new LangGraph application tailored to your specific requirements.

3. **Followed the Patterns**: I used the same structure and patterns shown in the reference materials:
   - Defining a state class
   - Creating node functions
   - Building a graph with edges
   - Compiling and running the graph

4. **Adapted to Your Needs**: I modified the patterns to fit your specific use case of document analysis and question answering.

This demonstrates how the reference files serve as a persistent knowledge base that I can access in future sessions, allowing me to "remember" and apply knowledge about technologies that weren't part of my training data.

The key advantage of this approach is that it provides detailed, structured information that remains accessible across multiple sessions, unlike the direct instruction or code examples approaches which only persist for the current session.

Would you like me to demonstrate the final approach (documentation links) or do you have any questions about the reference files approach?

🤖

>> Let's move on to the final approahc with documentation links.
🤖

🤖 I'll demonstrate the documentation links approach for learning new programming knowledge.

## Documentation Links Approach

With this approach, you share links to official documentation, tutorials, or other resources about new technologies. I can read and process these resources to learn about technologies that weren't available during my training.

### Example Demonstration

Let's say you want to teach me about a new Python library called "Pydantic V2" which had significant updates after my training cutoff:

🤖

🤖 Now, let me demonstrate how I would use these documentation links to learn about Pydantic V2 and apply that knowledge:

**Me**: "I've read through the Pydantic V2 migration guide and models documentation. Based on this information, I can now explain the key changes in Pydantic V2 and how to use its new features:

### Key Changes in Pydantic V2

1. **Model Configuration Changes**:
   - The `Config` inner class is now deprecated in favor of a `model_config` dictionary
   - Many config options have been renamed, like `orm_mode` → `from_attributes`
   - Example: `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True, str_to_lower=True)`

2. **Method Name Changes**:
   - Most methods now follow a `model_*` naming pattern
   - `dict()` → `model_dump()`
   - `parse_obj()` → `model_validate()`
   - `json()` → `model_dump_json()`
   - `update_forward_refs()` → `model_rebuild()`

3. **Validator Changes**:
   - `@validator` is deprecated in favor of `@field_validator`
   - `@root_validator` is deprecated in favor of `@model_validator`
   - Validators now use an `info` parameter to access metadata instead of `field` and `config`

4. **New Features**:
   - `TypeAdapter` for validating non-model types
   - `RootModel` for custom root types (replacing `__root__` fields)
   - Improved serialization with `@field_serializer` and `@model_serializer`
   - Better support for `Annotated` types

5. **Package Structure Changes**:
   - `BaseSettings` moved to `pydantic-settings` package
   - Some types moved to `pydantic-extra-types` package
   - Constrained types removed in favor of `Annotated[Type, Field(...)]`

Let me show you how to use some of these new features with a practical example:

```python
from typing import Annotated, List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field, TypeAdapter, field_validator

# Using the new model_config instead of Config class
class User(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        from_attributes=True,  # Replaces orm_mode
        str_to_lower=True,     # Replaces anystr_lower
        validate_default=True  # Replaces validate_all
    )

    id: int
    name: str
    email: Annotated[str, Field(pattern=r'^\S+@\S+\.\S+$')]
    tags: List[str] = []

    # Using field_validator instead of validator
    @field_validator('name')
    def validate_name(cls, v, info):
        if len(v) < 2:
            raise ValueError(f'Name must be at least 2 characters')
        return v.title()  # Return capitalized name

# Using TypeAdapter for non-model validation
ListOfUsers = TypeAdapter(List[User])

# Example usage
user_data = {'id': 1, 'name': 'john', 'email': 'john@example.com'}
user = User.model_validate(user_data)  # Instead of parse_obj

# Serialization
user_dict = user.model_dump()  # Instead of .dict()
user_json = user.model_dump_json()  # Instead of .json()

# Using TypeAdapter
users_data = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'john', 'email': 'john@example.com'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'jane', 'email': 'jane@example.com'}
]
users = ListOfUsers.validate_python(users_data)
```

This example demonstrates the key changes in Pydantic V2, including the new configuration approach, validator syntax, and the TypeAdapter feature. Would you like me to explain any specific aspect in more detail?"

## Documentation Links Approach - Explanation

I've just demonstrated the documentation links approach for learning new programming knowledge. Here's how it works:

### How It Works

1. **Access Official Documentation**: You share links to official documentation, tutorials, or other resources about new technologies. In this case, I accessed the Pydantic V2 migration guide and models documentation.

2. **Process and Understand**: I read through the documentation to understand the key concepts, changes, and features of the technology.

3. **Synthesize Knowledge**: I synthesized the information into a coherent understanding of the technology, focusing on the most important aspects.

4. **Apply Knowledge**: I demonstrated how to apply this knowledge by creating a practical example that showcases the key features and changes.

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Authoritative Information**: Official documentation provides the most accurate and up-to-date information about a technology.

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documentation typically covers all aspects of a technology, from basic concepts to advanced features.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Documentation often explains not just how to use a technology, but why certain design decisions were made.

4. **Real-time Updates**: As the technology evolves, the documentation is updated, allowing me to access the latest information.

5. **Efficiency**: This approach is often faster than creating detailed reference files, especially for well-documented technologies.

### Limitations

1. **Session-bound Knowledge**: Like the direct instruction and code examples approaches, this knowledge is only available for the current session.

2. **Documentation Quality Varies**: The effectiveness of this approach depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the available documentation.

3. **Processing Overhead**: Reading and processing documentation takes time, which might be less efficient for quick, specific questions.

4. **Limited to Available Documentation**: This approach only works for technologies that have accessible documentation.

### When to Use This Approach

The documentation links approach is particularly useful when:

1. You need information about a well-documented technology
2. You want authoritative information directly from the source
3. You need a comprehensive understanding of a technology
4. The technology is actively evolving, and you need the latest information

For technologies with poor documentation or for very specific use cases, the other approaches (direct instruction, code examples, or reference files) might be more appropriate.
